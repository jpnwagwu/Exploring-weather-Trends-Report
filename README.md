# Exploring-Toronto- weather-Trends-Report


In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.


My goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live. 

To do this, I’ll follow the steps below:

Extract the data from the database. To interact with the database, you'll need to write a SQL query.
Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.
Open up the CSV in Excel
Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. 
Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends. Here are some questions to get you started.
Is my city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
“How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
